    "1. Use the `requests` library (or any other similar library at your choice) to download historical Buoy data\n",
    "3. Save all data you downloaded into (a) file(s). If you feel like it, only save that part that is relevant for your second part.\n",
    "4. Use a html parser library (e.g., `BeautifulSoup`, `lxml`, or `html5lib`) to extract the meaning of the data (i.e. what is it measuring and what are the units?). Also save this information somewhere.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2: Processing the data\n",
    "6. (Optional) use the `pandas` library to read the data and process as needed, and save the processed data if you want to. Save the processed data\n",
    "7. plot the oceant temperatures (`WTMP`), wave heights (`WVHT`), average wave periods (`APD`), and wind speeds (`WSPD`) going back 10 years or so (some buoys don't have all the data every year)\n",
    "8. Look through `scipy.stats` and choose something like Pearson's or Spearman's correlation test. Determine what (if any) correlations you find between mean ocean temperatures and maximum wave heights or wave periods.\n"
